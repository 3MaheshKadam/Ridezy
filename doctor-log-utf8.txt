Γ£û Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in C:\Users\harsh\Documents\Ridezy\app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'usesCleartextTraffic'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

Γ£û Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Unmaintained: react-native-animatable, react-native-maps-directions
  No metadata available: framer-motion, lightningcss, lucide-react, react-native-otp-inputs, react-native-vector-icons
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
